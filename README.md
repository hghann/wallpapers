# Worthyox's Wallpaper Collection

I have collected these wallpapers over a number of years. This is my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them.
## Where did I get these?
I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include Imgur and /wg/. Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.
## Ownership
Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
