# Steve's Wallpaper Collection

I have collected these wallpapers over a number of years. This is my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them. Created with a slightly modified version of [make_gallery.sh](https://github.com/jonascarpay/Wallpapers/blob/master/make_gallery.sh) script by Jonas Carpay.
## Where did I get these?
I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) and [/wg/](https://boards.4chan.org/wg/). Some of the wallpapers are from other people's wallpaper repos namely [Jonas Carpay](https://github.com/jonascarpay/Wallpapers), [MAKC](https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers), [DT](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers), [Christian Chiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/wallpapers), and [Gavin Freeborn](https://github.com/Gavinok/wallpapers).
## Ownership
Since I got these mostly from sites like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [/wg/](https://boards.4chan.org/wg/), and [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/), I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
